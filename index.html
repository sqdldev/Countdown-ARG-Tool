        <h1>Wow...</h1>
        <p>
          I never expected to get to here. Where even are we? Right. We are
          at... the ANSWER!!!
          <br />
          The last hidden video uploaded by Countdown is "ANSWER". Thanks to the
          smartness of somebody else, I was able to adjust Countdown ARG Tool's
          code to show the actual intended image instead of a pixel jumble.
          <br />
          <img src="assets/genius.png" />
          <br />
          Apparently, I have been doing the entire ARG wrong lol...
          <br />
          We were supposed to wait until the last day and use Day 0's hidden
          video to solve the ARG, hence the video's name being "ANSWER" in Morse
          Code.
          <br />
          But, I brute forced a solve using what we expected the solution to be.
          It was okay for the lyrics, but not very great for the actual image.
          <br />
          With our Discord friend's idea, I was able to edit the code of
          Countdown ARG Tool to display the REAL unscrambled image.
          <br />
          Here is the actual incredible image we have all been working hard for.
        </p>
        <canvas class="card" id="videoHexCodesOut"
          >Your browser does not support Canvas</canvas
        >
        <p>
          <br />
          If you're interested in the technicalities of the solution, this
          section is for you.
          <br />
          As I breifly touched on in the previous paragraph, Day 0's "ANSWER"
          video had the key to solve Countdown ARG. Check out this screen
          capture of the "ANSWER" video.
          <br />
          <img src="assets/day0.png" />
          <br />
          Each number is between 1-100 (Arranged in a 10x10 matrix), meaning it
          corresponds to the Hex Code (Pixel Color)
          <b>AND</b> the Morse Code of that specific day. As our friend
          "@icantthinkofadisplayname" on Discord put it.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The first number is 72, so I checked back that video in your tool's
          history of unlisted videos and got a colour that makes sense, though
          that could be a coincidence.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <br />
          This person on YouTube also figured out the solution independently
          from our friend on Discord, so props to them too.
          <br />

          <br />
          <br />
          Despite the "Decode Morse" header being mostly wrong, I will keep it
          there anyways.
          <br />
          This is a bittersweet end to the Countdown ARG. The only real thing
          keeping me sane throughout this summer was actually waking up every
          day and adding a new number to this ARG Tool. At the same time, I'm
          happy that this ended, so I don't have to deal with the goofiness of
          Replit...
